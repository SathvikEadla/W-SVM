<div class="textblock"><pre class="fragment">This library provides support for meta-recognition, i.e. recognizing when a recognition system is working well and when it is not and using that self-knowledge to improve the system.    It can be used for prediction of failure,  fusion,  score renormalization, SVM renormalization and converting SVM or recognition scores into statistially well supported probility estimtes.  The analysis is based on an analysis of the recognition system scores. 
</pre><p>The fundamental ideas are described in</p>
<p>"Meta-Recognition: The Theory and Practice of Recognition Score Analysis," Walter J. Scheirer, Anderson Rocha, Ross Micheals, Terrance E. Boult, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (T-PAMI), 33(8), pp 1689&ndash;1695, Aug, 2011.</p>
<p>and SVM support as described in</p>
<p>"Multi-Attribute Spaces: Calibration for Attribute Fusion and Similarity Search," Walter J. Scheirer, Neeraj Kumar, Peter N. Belhumeur, Terrance E. Boult, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2012.</p>
<p>The underlying extream value theory provide stong theortical basis for the computations, but to make it useful one must transform the data into the proper frame. The C++ version provides objects that can compute and store information about the transform and then provide for prediction, w-score values (probability estimates), or renormalizatoin of a vector of data.</p>
<p>The library also contains a "C" interface functions for very basic weilbull usage for Meta-Recognition. The C-based library has a number of STRONG assumptions you must follow as we cannot test for all of them. 1) All fitting and testing are presuming "larger is better", If you are fitting something where smaller is better you need to transform it before fitting. 2) All data is positive (okay we can and do test for that, but better to know upfront what you are doing) 3) There must be sufficient range in your data to actually fit the weilbull. If all the data is the same, or nearly the same, it may fal to converge and will report errors.</p>
